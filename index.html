	               <p>Communication is our basic need and we are living in a world where communication between people is increasing 
					   exponentially day by day. As we all know that pictures when delivered with words are much better than words alone. 
					   So, illustration or pictorial representation is a technique, if used correctly with written or spoken words gives 
					   more impact on the listener or viewer. The influence of multimedia can see in every aspect of human life.

	               <p>
					This age can be considered as the character and personality building age of a human. The data, which is perceived by 
					a human from his environment, is passed through a phase that is called analysis. This analysis is done based on previous 
					learning, past experiences, moral values and personal interests. So, the medium of instruction and the method of delivery 
					should be more responsible, because at this age any change that occurs in a human’s personality would be permanent.

					Multimedia is used in a wide variety of fields. These applications are commonly associated with immersive, highly visual

					  role of multimedia is a digital invention of equipment like cameras and high definition televisions, computers.
					   Concerning the development of technology, we believe that in the future, the use of multimedia teaching will be further developed.
